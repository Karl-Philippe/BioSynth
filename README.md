# Project Title: Biomusic Synthesizer Controlled by Vital Signs and Movements

## Description
This project is about creating an innovative tool that combines the fields of music, biomedicine, rehabilitation, and physiotherapy. It involves an interactive musical synthesizer that generates real-time music based on the user’s vital signs, such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen levels, while also being controlled by body movements.

## Key Features

- **Biomedical Signal Acquisition**: The system uses an affordable RGB camera to capture the user’s vital signs. Deep learning models analyze the images in real-time to extract biomedical data.

- **Movement Detection**: Integration with the YOLO model allows tracking of the user's body movements, influencing musical composition.

- **Sound Synthesis Engine**: A high-quality sound synthesis engine creates music in real-time. Musical parameters such as tone, tempo, instrument, melody, etc., are dynamically adjusted.

- **Intuitive User Interface**: Users have access to a user-friendly interface that allows them to customize their musical experience, set rehabilitation goals, or simply create music playfully.

- **Rehabilitation and Physiotherapy Modes**: The software offers specific modes for post-operative rehabilitation and physiotherapy. Music is tailored to help patients achieve their recovery goals.

- **Real-Time Visual and Auditory Feedback**: Users receive real-time visual and auditory feedback to understand how their vital signs and movements influence the music. This feature can also serve educational and therapeutic purposes.

## Project Goals

- Offer a unique musical creation experience by combining elements of biomedicine and music technology.
- Provide a therapeutic tool for post-operative rehabilitation and physiotherapy, aiding patient recovery.
- Enable users to better understand the relationship between their health status and music, promoting awareness of their well-being.

## Potential Impact
This project has the potential to revolutionize both the music industry and the healthcare sector. It can be used in hospitals, rehabilitation clinics, long-term care facilities, as well as by musicians and music enthusiasts for creative purposes. By integrating elements of music therapy and biomedical technology, it will contribute to improving the quality of life for patients.

## Considerations

- **Medical Data Privacy**: Ensuring the confidentiality of medical data.
- **Image Capture Device Security**: Ensuring the safety of image capture devices.
- **Collaboration with Healthcare Professionals**: Collaborating with healthcare professionals for clinical evaluation.
- **Compliance with Medical Standards**: Adhering to medical and device safety standards.

This ambitious project brings together seemingly disparate fields to create an innovative and versatile tool that could have a significant impact on music, rehabilitation, and physiotherapy.
